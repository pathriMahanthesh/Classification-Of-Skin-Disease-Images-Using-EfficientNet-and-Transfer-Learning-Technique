# Classification-Of-Skin-Disease-Images-Using-EfficientNet-and-Transfer-Learning-Technique

Project Overview
This project focuses on the classification of skin disease images using EfficientNet, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, combined with Transfer Learning.
The goal is to develop an accurate and efficient system for diagnosing skin diseases from images, which can assist dermatologists in early and accurate diagnosis.

Skin diseases are a major global health concern, and early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify skin disease images into different categories. The use of EfficientNet and Transfer Learning ensures high accuracy while minimizing computational costs.

Accurate Classification: Achieves high accuracy in classifying skin disease images.
- EfficientNet: Uses a scalable and efficient CNN architecture.
- Transfer Learning: Reduces training time and improves performance by fine-tuning a pre-trained model.
- User-Friendly: Provides an easy-to-use interface for predicting skin diseases from images.

Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras
- Model Architecture: EfficientNet (B0-B7)
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV
